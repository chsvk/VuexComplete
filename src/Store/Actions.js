 // actions are used to perform Asynchronous tasks.

    // Actions need to be dispatched just like mutations has to be commited
    // this.$store.dispatch('reducePrice)
    // Actions can take parameters as context, which is very much similar to state
    // Actions can be very complex but should not update the state
